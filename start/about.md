# 1. Markets are conversations.

!SLIDE center smaller
# 2. Markets consist of human beings, not demographic sectors.

# 3. Conversations among human beings sound human. They are conducted in a human voice.

# 4. Whether delivering information, opinions, perspectives, dissenting arguments or humorous asides, the human voice is typically open, natural, uncontrived. 

!SLIDE center smaller
# 5. People recognize each other as such from the sound of this voice.

# 6. The Internet is enabling conversations among human beings that were simply not possible in the era of mass media.

# 7. Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy.

# 8. In both internetworked markets and among intranetworked employees, people are speaking to each other in a powerful new way.

# 9. These networked conversations are enabling powerful new forms of social organization and knowledge exchange to emerge.

# 10. As a result, markets are getting smarter, more informed, more organized. Participation in a networked market changes people fundamentally.

# 11. People in networked markets have figured out that they get far better information and support from one another than from vendors. So much for corporate rhetoric about adding value to commoditized products. 

!SLIDE center smaller
# 12. There are no secrets. The networked market knows more than companies do about their own products. And whether the news is good or bad, they tell everyone.

# 13. What's happening to markets is also happening among employees. A metaphysical construct called "The Company" is the only thing standing between the two. 

!SLIDE center smaller
# 14. Corporations do not speak in the same voice as these new networked conversations. To their intended online audiences, companies sound hollow, flat, literally inhuman. 

!SLIDE center smaller 
# 15. In just a few more years, the current homogenized "voice" of business—the sound of mission statements and brochures—will seem as contrived and artificial as the language of the 18th century French court. 

!SLIDE center smaller
# 16. Already, companies that speak in the language of the pitch, the dog-and-pony show, are no longer speaking to anyone. 

!SLIDE center smaller
# 17. Companies that assume online markets are the same markets that used to watch their ads on television are kidding themselves. 

!SLIDE center smaller
# 18. Companies that don't realize their markets are now networked person-to-person, getting smarter as a result and deeply joined in conversation are missing their best opportunity.

!SLIDE center smaller 
# 19. Companies can now communicate with their markets directly. If they blow it, it could be their last chance. 

!SLIDE center smaller 
# 20. Companies need to realize their markets are often laughing. At them.
