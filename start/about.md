# 1. Markets are conversations.

!SLIDE 
# 2. Markets consist of human beings, not demographic sectors.

!SLIDE 
# 3. Conversations among human beings sound human. They are conducted in a human voice. 

!SLIDE 
# 4. Whether delivering information, opinions, perspectives, dissenting arguments or humorous asides, the human voice is typically open, natural, uncontrived. 

!SLIDE 
# 5. People recognize each other as such from the sound of this voice.

!SLIDE 
# 6. The Internet is enabling conversations among human beings that were simply not possible in the era of mass media. 

!SLIDE 
# 7. Hyperlinks subvert hierarchy. 

!SLIDE 
# 8. In both internetworked markets and among intranetworked employees, people are speaking to each other in a powerful new way. 

!SLIDE 
# 9. These networked conversations are enabling powerful new forms of social organization and knowledge exchange to emerge. 

!SLIDE 
# 10. As a result, markets are getting smarter, more informed, more organized. Participation in a networked market changes people fundamentally.

!SLIDE 
# 11. People in networked markets have figured out that they get far better information and support from one another than from vendors. So much for corporate rhetoric about adding value to commoditized products. 

!SLIDE 
# 12. There are no secrets. The networked market knows more than companies do about their own products. And whether the news is good or bad, they tell everyone. 

!SLIDE 
# 13. What's happening to markets is also happening among employees. A metaphysical construct called "The Company" is the only thing standing between the two. 

!SLIDE 
# 14. Corporations do not speak in the same voice as these new networked conversations. To their intended online audiences, companies sound hollow, flat, literally inhuman. 

!SLIDE 
# 15. In just a few more years, the current homogenized "voice" of business—the sound of mission statements and brochures—will seem as contrived and artificial as the language of the 18th century French court. 

!SLIDE 
# 16. Already, companies that speak in the language of the pitch, the dog-and-pony show, are no longer speaking to anyone. 

!SLIDE 
# 17. Companies that assume online markets are the same markets that used to watch their ads on television are kidding themselves. 

!SLIDE 
# 18. Companies that don't realize their markets are now networked person-to-person, getting smarter as a result and deeply joined in conversation are missing their best opportunity.

!SLIDE 
# 19. Companies can now communicate with their markets directly. If they blow it, it could be their last chance. 

!SLIDE 
# 20. Companies need to realize their markets are often laughing. At them. 

!SLIDE 
# 21. Companies need to lighten up and take themselves less seriously. They need to get a sense of humor. 

!SLIDE 
# 22. Getting a sense of humor does not mean putting some jokes on the corporate web site. Rather, it requires big values, a little humility, straight talk, and a genuine point of view. 

!SLIDE 
# 23. Companies attempting to "position" themselves need to take a position. Optimally, it should relate to something their market actually cares about. 

!SLIDE 
# 24. Bombastic boasts—"We are positioned to become the preeminent provider of XYZ"—do not constitute a position. 

!SLIDE 
# 25. Companies need to come down from their Ivory Towers and talk to the people with whom they hope to create relationships. 

!SLIDE 
# 26. Public Relations does not relate to the public. Companies are deeply afraid of their markets. 

!SLIDE 
# 27. By speaking in language that is distant, uninviting, arrogant, they build walls to keep markets at bay. 

!SLIDE 
# 28. Most marketing programs are based on the fear that the market might see what's really going on inside the company. 

!SLIDE 
# 29. Elvis said it best: "We can't go on together with suspicious minds." 

!SLIDE 
# 30. Brand loyalty is the corporate version of going steady, but the breakup is inevitable—and coming fast. Because they are networked, smart markets are able to renegotiate relationships with blinding speed. 

!SLIDE 
# 31. Networked markets can change suppliers overnight. Networked knowledge workers can change employers over lunch. Your own "downsizing initiatives" taught us to ask the question: "Loyalty? What's that?" 

!SLIDE 
# 32. Smart markets will find suppliers who speak their own language. 

!SLIDE 
# 33. Learning to speak with a human voice is not a parlor trick. It can't be "picked up" at some tony conference. 

!SLIDE 
# 34. To speak with a human voice, companies must share the concerns of their communities. 

!SLIDE 
# 35. But first, they must belong to a community.
